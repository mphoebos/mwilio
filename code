# First I would use the code above to send SMS to my customers using Twilio Ruby, focusing on their experience when using my taxi services.
# Unhappy customers would reply to the fake number. At the same time using Twilio Studio, I've build a Trigger to the Incoming SMS reply.
# This would forward to AutoPilot where the target task is 'Talk_to_Support'.
# On 'Talk_to_SupportÂ´, the bot would start the conversation with the message:
# "Thank you for your feedback. A customer support representative will be with you shortly."

# I've build the Twilio Studio and AutoPilot on my Twilio account marcoadmateus@gmail.com.
